        <h1> Course Description </h1>
        <p> This is a graduate-level introductory course to the technical fundamentals of physical computing and interactive art. In this class we will cover the basics of circuit design and analysis (both analog and digital), and interaction design utilizing various inputs and outputs including sensors, screen based visualizers, and motors. We will also cover programming in Arduino and P5.js, a javascript framework for creative code, that allows for building unique physical-digital interfaces. The class will provide context for these tools, and an overview of the contemporary and historical landscape of electronic and interactive art.</p>

        <h1> Learning Outcomes </h1>
        <p> Create engaging and critically relevant interactive projects</p>
        <p>Demonstrate the ability to bring a creative electronics project from concept to completion through researching tools, sourcing hardware, building circuits, and writing software</p>
        <p>Understand the basic principles and techniques necessary to create interactive systems using a microcontroller, sensors, actuators, and javascript</p>

        <h1> General Course Structure </h1>

        <div class="indent">
          <p><strong>Discussion/Crits</strong>: Presentation of weekly assignments, Q/A from the labs </p>
          <p><strong>Lecture</strong>: Technical concepts and their history, relationship to society, and art</p>
          <p><strong>Lab</strong>: In class workshop of technical material </p>

        <h1> Course Expections + Grading </h1>

        <h3> Lab Reports (Blog Posts)<h3> 
        <p>Labs are weekly skillbuilding assignments. They may include, readings, circuit building, and/or programming. Lab reports serve as documentation as well as an assessment of your understanding and an opportunity to raise questions. Requirements for each lab report will be posted with each lab assignment. Lab reports are submitted in the form of a blog post. Students can either submit a link of a list of tagged posts or can create a blog devoted entirely to the class. It is up to each student on what service they prefer (github, tumblr, wordpress, squarespace, cargo, etc.).</p>
        <p>All class projects as well as labs need to be documented with videos, photos, and if applicable, circuit diagrams. Documentation is important not only for archiving your work, but serves as an important resource for the open source community. Submit a link to your blog through <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CydOXwjUiJBCdcISfLns9j6bs2Zsy1me73qwEdLh8I8/edit?usp=sharing">this doc.</a></p>

        <h3>Midterm Project<h3> 
        <p>The midterm is an opportunity to apply the skills from the first six weeks of the semester into a robust project.</p>

        <h3>Final Project<h3> 
        <p>The final is an opportunity to create a more advanced interactive project that fits within the students body of work or area of inquiry. Students will submit proposals containing a brief project statment, diagrams, timeline, and any necessary supporting material. Students will present in class to outside guests.</p>

        <h3>Lateness</h3> 
        <p>Turning in assignments late will result in an automatic half letter grade reduction for the assignment.</p>

        <h3>Unexcused Absences</h3>
        <p>Two (2) or more unexcused abscences is grounds for failure.</p>

        <h3>Electronic Devices</h3> 
        <p>Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lecture. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations. Phone use in class is strictly prohibited unless directly related to a presentation of your own work or if you are asked to do so as part of the curriculum.</p>
